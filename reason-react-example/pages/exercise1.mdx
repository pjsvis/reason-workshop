# Exercise 1: Stateless Component

Let's write a stateless component `ColorSquare` with following specs:

```js
<ColorSquare color="red" size=50 />
```

**Properties:**
- **color**: Red, Green, Blue or Yellow (use [variants](https://reasonml.github.io/docs/en/variant) for this!)
- **size**: Pixel size starting from 0. Negative numbers are set to 0.

## Tasks
- Create a file `components/ColorSquare.re` and define a stateless component with the required props
- Define a variant type for the `color`
- Define a make function which takes a `~color` and `~size` argument
- For styling, use either inline styles via the ReasonReact <a href="https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/style#docsNav" target="_blank"> Style API</a> or via CSS-Modules

## Output

Use your `<ColorSquare/>` component in the render function of `components/Exercise1Output.re` (will be rendered below)
<Exercise1Output />

## Tips

- `.mdx` files are JavaScript land. Always make sure to use `genType` for automatically converting ReasonReact components to ReactJS components.
- Use `[@genType]` annotations on `make` functions to make a ReasonReact component importable in JavaScript
- Check out `layout/layout.re` to find out how to use CSS-Modules in Reason (`<div className=style##root` />)
- Also check out already existing components if you are stuck on certain things

## Reflect
- How would this be designed in JS?
- How well defined are the boundaries of the input?
